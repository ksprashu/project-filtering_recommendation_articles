The input values are currently set with one idea in mind that you may use to make content based recommendations.

      "What is Spark SQL and DataFrames?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Apache Spark SQL is a Spark module for structured data processing. Unlike the\r\n",
      "basic Spark RDD API, the interfaces provided by Spark SQL provide Spark with\r\n",
      "more information about the structure of both the data and the computation being\r\n",
      "performed. Internally, Spark SQL uses this extra information to perform extra\r\n",
      "optimizations. There are several ways to interact with Spark SQL including SQL,\r\n",

      "R/Python, but with richer optimizations under the hood. DataFrames can be\r\n",
